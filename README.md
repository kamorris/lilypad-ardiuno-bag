# lilypad-ardiuno-bag
code + schematic for ardiuno-powered bag

Knit a bag (following instructions on knitty, http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEss10/PATTknowitall.php).  If you're not into knitting, you can make a bag from fabric, but use something thick, like felt or polar fleece - if the fabric flexes too much, parts of the circuit will not light up.  Use conductive thread to sew in the lilypad, battery pack and LEDs using the pattern provided here, and upload the code to the arduino.  No soldering required; itâ€™s just sewing.  To get a good connection, use backstitch or sew over the lines repeatedly.
